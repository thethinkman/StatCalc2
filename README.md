# Statistics-Calculator-for-Android
Statistics Calculator for android I made a couple years ago. Works well for Maximum Liklihood and Log Liklihood calculations using external data files, with cloud support. Does still work on Android 6.0+ with full cloud support using Material API.

//Description: 	This program for Android devices is a basic statistics calculator that performs

//              functions that have been covered in Scientific Computing, in addition to mean 

//              and standard deviation. It uses the Storage Access Framework, introduced in 

//              Android 4.4.4. Users on older versions of Android will still be able to use the

//              application, but will be prompted to use an installed file explorer.
